            who have the highest points. These five teams will compete on a life-sized snake and
            ladders board. Where instead of rolling a dice, each team will proceed based on the answers
            they give.<br>
            Once the question is shown on the screen each team must choose the correct option out of
            the four within 30seconds and put it down on a chit and press the buzzer. The anchors will
            come and collect the chit. Once the 30seconds period has elapsed then the anchors will
            announce the answers of each team and the number of steps they are to take on the board.
            Just as the rules of snakes and ladders if one reaches the bottom of a ladder then they must
            climb up the ladder. But if you get bitten by a snake you come down the snake.

           The classic draw and guess game, but with a slight twist. In teams of two, with three rounds each
          including the emoji-nary,the taboo round and the classic Pictionary round, one player draws the words given on
          the chit (movie,show,object,character), and the other player guesses. In the case of emoji-nary, words on the
          chit but with emojis. Verbal communication between the two players is not allowed.

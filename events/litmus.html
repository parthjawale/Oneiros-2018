              that before this round starts each team will be allotted different starting points on the
              board based on the number of points they have acquired over the last two rounds. The
              team with the highest points will be placed higher up on the board and the one with the
              least of the five teams will be placed at 0. Each tile on the board will have a multiple choice
              question which needs to be answered within 30seconds. If the team does give the correct
              answer then based on their time they will take a certain number of steps on the board. And
              if the team fails to answer the question then they remain on the same tile and in their next
              turn will receive a new question. The team to reach the last tile first will be the team that

      When George Land tried to find out all about creativity he came to a very clear
conclusion: we are all born creative, but throughout our lives, we ‘unlearn’ it. There
are not a lot of moments in your life when you can scream ‘I’m hunting a Tiger!’
while crawling on the ground pretending to study daffodils. And when did you last
tell your professor: “I love you, honey, won’t you give me a smile?” Sounds fun isn’t
it! It’ll be a way more fun when all you have to be is, a 5 year old with no boundaries
of imagination. Mission Improvable is an improv competition that involves various
games in it. So stay witty and keep a count cause best team will win it all.
